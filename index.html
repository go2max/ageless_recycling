                        <summary>Can I recycle large volumes?</summary>
                        <p>Residential pickups are generally limited to <strong>100 lbs per visit</strong>. If you
                            regularly
                            have more
                            than this, we’re happy to discuss options to accommodate larger volumes. Commercial pickups
                            can
                            also accept
                            higher amounts at adjusted rates. Contact us to arrange a larger pickup or special
                            scheduling.

                        <p>We accept recyclables in any container — bags, boxes, bins, or totes — as long as we can
